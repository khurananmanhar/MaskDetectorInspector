# MaskDetectorInspector
## Inspiration
COVID-19, a name of a deadly virus that has shocked and completely moved the world. It has taken or even affected the lives of millions. One way to prevent the spread of this virus is to protect your face and wear a mask. Right now, masks are known all across the world, but not all people obey the "rules" of wearing a mask and potentially saving their lives!!! Because of this issue, my group members and I created a program that detects if a person has a mask on or not.


## What it does
The MID works on an upload system. The user has to upload an image and the output should indicate on how many people or if people are wearing a mask to protect themselves or not.


## How we built it
We used Python to build it. We also used a neural network to set it up.

## Challenges we ran into
There was a problem with the flask since the CSS wasn't displaying correctly within the Flask application. Another problem was that, we were getting constant errors with the program and the model which was used in order to detect masks.

## What we learned
We learned about the neural network and the different hidden laters and how we can manipulate it in order to meet our terms. We also learned how to use flask with python and display our website

## What's next for MID (Mask Inspector Detector)
We are planning to incorporate a live video section where the user can use their webcam and the system will say whether the people in the webcam are wearing a mask or not. We are alreayd in development on a website.
